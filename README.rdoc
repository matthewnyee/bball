RSVP data as part of user resource
-must reset for users who havenâ€™t updated, otherwise old data will still show
-reset all user data during gametime???
-@user.next, @user.next_next


RSVP data as new resource
-no need for new pages




1. add migration adding 'status' column
  (later, add validations for Going/NotGoing/MightGo/NoResponse)
2. add select (or whatever it's called) to edit view, then modify update method in controller
3. modify index view to show
4. activejobs/crono stuff

User.update_all(status: 'NoResponse')


add back link to edit page

add radio buttons to "new user" page

take out (refactor) radio buttons into _form (DRY code)
